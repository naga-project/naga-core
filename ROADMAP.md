The JxBrowser support will offer a web view that developers can use to run, test and debug the web version of their WebFX app directly from Java (no GWT compilation required). The IDE will simply run your app with the WebFX runtime (instead of OpenJFX) in the JVM, and the DOM generated by WebFX will be rendered in JxBrowser (a Chromium-based browser controlled by Java). This will considerably speed up the development cycle of web apps.

An effort will also be made to make the WebFX transpiler as agnostic as possible.  Alternative transpilers (such as J2CL & TeaVM) will be considered. Whereas GWT is a Java source transpiler, TeaVM is a byte-code transpiler, which will also open the door to alternative JVM languages such as Kotlin.

Some redesign work is also necessary to transit from the current patching process (which is mainly a manual patch of OpenJFX 8) to a more professional patching process with tooling allowing regular rebasing onto OpenJFX.

Finally, WebFX will allow you to customize your JavaFX coverage. The minimal coverage will prioritize performance and exclude features having a big impact on the resultant JS, such as JavaFX CSS (look at the [FX2048 demo](https://github.com/webfx-demos/webfx-demo-fx2048/) to see how to make a separate HTML version and JavaFX version of your CSS instead). But if you still wish to use JavaFX CSS in your web app, you will be able to enable the CSS coverage. More coverages (such as FXML, 3D, etc...) will be planned in the future.
