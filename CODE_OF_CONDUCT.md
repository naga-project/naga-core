<p style="text-align: center;">All what we do depends on our mind. If we have a good mind, we will perform good actions.</p>

**A mind of belief**

WebFX is a belief. We believe it's possible. How wonderful if it was made. We wish to make it.

**A mind of imagination**

WebFX if the fruit of our imagination. Everything starts in the imagination. Let's now use the power of our mind to bring that imagination into reality.

**A mind of effort**

With laziness, we can't accomplish anything. With effort, we can accomplish everything. Let's apply great effort to achieve our goal.

Effort doesn't mean pain. Effort means joy. Otherwise, how could we maintain a constant effort?

**A mind of respect**

Everybody is welcome to join our community. Everyone is equally important. Everybody matters.

**A mind of tolerance**

Each one can have different views and opinions, they are all valuable and will be considered, but of course in the end, choices have to be made.

Things might not go in the direction we want. That's not a reason to become angry. Let's just trust and accept joyfully what's happening.

**A mind of generosity**

Let's give everything. We may have some private repositories, but only because they are not yet ready for sharing. In the end, all our repositories will be public.

**A mind of gratitude**

Without others, we are nothing. Our project would have no meaning. Thank you so much to be there. And what a kindness if you even help us!
